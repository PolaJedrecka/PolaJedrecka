### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Pola and I am passionate about programming both in backend and frontend (a bit more in frontend :D).

I can easily say I have very optimistic and amusing kind of personality. When it comes to problem solving, I definitely prefer positive approach. Being negative does not satisfy me at all. Due to me being new in programming world (I am here only for 1 year!), I'm staying open to learn new technologies, approaches etc. Now I'm programming using mostly .Net and React.
